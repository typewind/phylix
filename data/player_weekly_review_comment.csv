Player1,22/05/2024 09:07,Shadika Willam,"The total distance of recent training doesn't meet the plan, need to check with player"

Player63,2024-05-25 09:02:03,Shuyao Chen,"here is a pattern that typically, the player completes 3 slightly shorter distance sessions (<10,000m) before a heavy session (>10,000m). However, this routine was disrupted on September 29, which saw a high-intensity session without the preceding shorter sessions. This irregularity likely contributed to the subsequent 16-day and then 2 months absence, suggesting a potential light injury due to inconsistent training.
"
Player63,2024-05-25 09:02:57,Shuyao Chen,"There is a notable drop in EWMA ACWR for Acc-Dec-COD per minute on September 29. Despite this decrease, the overall player load remained consistently high. This indicates an irregular increase in physical activity on the z-axis.
